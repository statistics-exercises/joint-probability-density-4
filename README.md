# Manipulating joint probability densities in python

The fourth part of the problem is:

The joint probability density function for the pair of continuous random variables (X,Y) is:

![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x,y)=k(x^2y^2%2Bxy^3)\quad\textrm{for}\quad\1<x<2\quad\textrm{and}\quad\0<y<3)

(4) Calculate the joint probability distribution function for the two variables.

Once again you need to add code on the left here to complete this part using SymPy.  Notice that I have defined the symbols `u` and `v` for these and that you can use these in place of the numbers in the limits for your integrals.  You need to set the variable called `cdf` equal to the cumulative probablity distribution function that you evaluate using SymPy.
